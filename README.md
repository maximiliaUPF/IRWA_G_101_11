# IRWA_G_101_11
Repository for the Team 11's IRWA project 

In order to execute this code, this time is a bit different than previous deliverables since now, instead of a ipynb file, we have now a folder with different python scripts and tools regarding opur web app.

In this repository, you will find the main files for the different parts of the project. To have specifically the one's from part-4, they'll be in the TAG upload.
There, you will find the inputs required for the code to be executed, the report and the folder with the web_app python scripts. The folder for the search engine contains the json data, as well as other folders with python scripts and html files in order to work properly. To run the code, you will have to change your directory of the command line to the folder where the web_app is and then execute it with a prompt **python web_app.py** . Then, the code is automatically executed and you just need to copy the http// adress that is shown in the cmd to your search engine and it will go automatically to the search engine that we have implemented. However, it's worth mentioning that in order to get the code to access the json file, you might need to change the path where it is found from the python script of web_app, adapting it to your path.
