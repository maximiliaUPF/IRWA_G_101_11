There, you will find the inputs required for the code to be executed, the report and the ypinb file. The ypinb file is the full code of our project, where there are the different functions from part 1 and 2, as well as plots for analysis, execution of the different queries, creation of datasets and dictionaries, everything grouped in different sections. To run the code, you only need to upload to collab storage the inputs and connect the collab to your unit, afterwards, the full code is executed automatically without any input needed.
